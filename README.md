Zoom with orthographicCamera:
- Zooming with a mouseWheel works smoothly on both windows and linux.
- Zoom limits:
  - TrackballControlâ€™s distanceMax and distanceMin properties both seem to be ignored on Linux and Windows for orthographicCamera (though it  works fine for perspectiveCamera in both systems)
